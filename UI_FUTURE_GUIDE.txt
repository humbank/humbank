Humbank UI Future Additions Guide
================================

Goal
----
Keep every new UI surface consistent with the premium dark-purple style used by the login, profile, settings, and search screens.

Core Style Rules
----------------
1) Always start full-screen pages with `HumbankGradientScreen`.
2) Put primary page content inside `HumbankPanelCard` when possible.
3) Prefer rounded corners:
   - Containers: 24dp to 28dp
   - Inputs/buttons: 12dp to 14dp
4) Keep spacing regular:
   - Outer page padding: 16dp to 24dp
   - Vertical gaps inside cards: 10dp to 16dp
5) Typography hierarchy:
   - Section label: subtle muted color
   - Main title: white, semibold
   - Support text: desaturated purple text

Color Guidance
--------------
- Background gradient: use shared values from `ui/AppStyle.kt`.
- Main text: white.
- Secondary text: muted lilac (e.g. #AFA6D4 / #9A92BE range).
- Primary action button: light-lilac background with dark purple text.
- Error text: soft red/pink on translucent dark red background.

Component Rules
---------------
- Text fields:
  - Use rounded shape.
  - Use subtle translucent fill.
  - Distinguish focused/unfocused borders.
- Buttons:
  - Full-width for major actions.
  - Keep action labels short and clear.
  - Provide disabled colors with enough contrast.
- Empty/error states:
  - Keep concise, centered, and styled consistently.

Behavior & UX Checklist
-----------------------
- [ ] Loading states exist for async actions.
- [ ] Buttons are disabled while loading.
- [ ] Error messages are human-friendly.
- [ ] Layout works at narrow widths.
- [ ] Text remains readable in dark mode.
- [ ] Navigation icons/descriptions are present.

Code Hygiene Checklist
----------------------
- [ ] Reuse shared styles/composables before creating one-off variants.
- [ ] Avoid inline magic numbers unless they match this design system.
- [ ] Remove debug logs before merging.
- [ ] Keep composables focused and readable.

If a New Screen Feels "Off"
----------------------------
Check these first:
1) Missing gradient or panel card.
2) Inconsistent corner radii.
3) Wrong text contrast.
4) Uneven spacing rhythm.
5) Action buttons not visually prioritized.
